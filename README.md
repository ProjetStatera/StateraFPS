Firstly, we are passionated by the development domain, so learning
a new language and make a game were more than a choice to us, we were
designed to do it.
Secondly, we've developped many games together during projects, driven by
school or by us, so the duo for the projet formed itself instantly as soon
as we were aware of this tournament.
Thirdly, we're great competitors and we love to try to be the best in a domain
especially when this one passionates us.
